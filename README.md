# minimaterials
![GitHub code size in bytes](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/code-size/winksplorer/minimaterials)

A tiny implementation of Material Design for use in lightweight web apps.

It's similar to Google's Material Design Lite, but minimaterials aims to:
- Support all Material Design versions (1, 2, and 3/You)
- Be smaller than Material Design Lite (or at least MD1)
- Be easier to write code for than Material Design Lite

It does not rely on any JavaScript and does not use NPM. It is simply a bundle of CSS.

# Building

You need GNU `make` and the `minify` CLI (The Go-based one, **NOT** the one from NPM).

To build a specific version of Material Design, simply do `make mdX`, where X is the Material version you need. For example, `make md1` will build the original Material from 2014, and `make md3` will build Material You.

To build all versions of Material Design (1, 2, and 3/You), run `make all`. It will bundle all the Material versions together into a single CSS file.

The result is `mm-X.min.css`, where X is either `md1`, `md2`, `md3`, or `all`.

# Screenshots

These screenshots were generated by the `screenshots` rule in the Makefile, which is dependent on `chromium`.
